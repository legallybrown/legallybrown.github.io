<p class="message">
  My name's Anoop - i've been learning to develop software since 2013 and currently work at [Float](http://floatapp.com), a cashflow forecasting add-on for [Xero](http://www.xero.com) mainly using Rails and Javascript. 

  I used to be an intellectual property lawyer and am interested in finding better ways for lawyers to get stuff done using software.
